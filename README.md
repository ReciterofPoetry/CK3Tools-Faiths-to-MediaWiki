# CK3Tools-Faiths-to-MediaWiki
Parses faiths from the Crusader Kings 3 mod into a mediawiki page.

It must be placed in the mod's root folder to work. It will deposit the output as a textfile on your desktop.

WINDOWS ONLY. Released as open source. If you want it for Mac or Linux then you can download it and compile it through Visual Studio for that but I make no guarantees.

This is an Alpha release. It's intended to work with all mods but it has only been tested for Godherja. If it breaks, please let me know on the [CK3 Mod Co-op Discord server](https://discord.gg/BPECFtjaF2). I will be the dude with `CK3Tools` in his server nickname.
